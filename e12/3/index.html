        <p>It is a sin to write this.</p>

        <p>It is a sin to think words no others think and to put them down upon a paper no others are to see.</p>

        <p>It is base and evil. It is as if we were speaking alone to no ears but our own. And we know well that there is no transgression blacker than to do or think alone.</p>

        <p>We have broken the laws.

        <p>The laws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations bid them so.</p>

        <p>May we be forgiven!</p>
